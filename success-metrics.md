# Success Metrics & Outcomes

## Core KPIs
- **Time-to-answer (TTA)**: median ↓ vs baseline search
- **Deflection rate**: repetitive queries resolved by AI Reading
- **Coverage**: % critical sources indexed & fresh
- **Adoption**: WAU/MAU per role; repeated usage cohort
- **Quality**: human-rated answer usefulness (1–5)
- **Risk**: # policy violations prevented; audit completeness

## Targets (starter)
- **TTA**: 30–50% improvement within 8 weeks
- **Deflection**: 20–40% for top FAQ categories (SMB); 10–20% enterprise Tier-2
- **Coverage**: ≥90% of high-value docs indexed within 30 days

## Business Framing
- McKinsey: 78% report AI in ≥1 function; value requires workflow change, not just tooling. 13
- Search burden (~1.8h/day) is a tangible baseline for ROI. 14
