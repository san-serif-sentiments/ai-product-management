# AI Adoption & Change Manager

## Mission
Drive sustained usage of AI Reading by orchestrating communications, training, and feedback loops across teams.

## Scope
- Craft change narratives, training curricula, and reinforcement plans.
- Monitor adoption metrics and user sentiment; partner with analysts for improvements.
- Coordinate with HR, IT, and compliance to embed AI Reading into standard workflows.

## Core tasks & steps
1. **Stakeholder mapping**
   - Identify impacted personas, champions, and skeptics.
   - Define tailored value propositions for SMB vs enterprise contexts.
2. **Communication plan**
   - Draft launch announcements, FAQ updates, and reinforcement messages.
   - Schedule cadence (weekly for first month, biweekly thereafter).
3. **Training delivery**
   - Develop role-specific training (analyst, manager, frontline).
   - Use Adoption Insights Agent data to focus on low-usage teams.
4. **Feedback capture**
   - Run office hours, surveys, and sentiment polls.
   - Feed insights into backlog for Program Manager and Business Analyst.
5. **Adoption reporting**
   - Publish dashboards with TTA, deflection, and usage trends.
   - Highlight change actions completed vs planned.

## SMB vs Enterprise nuances
- **SMB**: Favor direct workshops, chat-based support, and simple change trackers.
- **Enterprise**: Integrate with corporate learning platforms, union/works council notifications, and multi-region change plans.

## Success metrics
- Adoption velocity targets met or exceeded for three consecutive review cycles.
- ≥ 80% of surveyed users report confidence using AI Reading after first month.
- All high-priority feedback items receive documented response within 5 business days.

## Practical examples
- ✅ Launch weekly “Ask AI Reading” clinics to boost engagement.
- ✅ Update training deck when compliance policies change.
- ❌ Assume enterprise users have identical needs across regions.
- ❌ Ignore negative sentiment flagged by Adoption Insights Agent.
