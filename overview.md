# Overview

## Why It Matters
- **Adoption is real but uneven**: 78% use AI in at least one function; winners are rewiring processes, not just adding chat UIs. 8
- **Knowledge friction costs**: ~1.8 hours/day searching; structured retrieval cuts time-to-answer. 9
- **Risk surface expands**: deepfakes, prompt-injection; SMBs affected. 10
- **Regulatory gravity**: EU AI Act’s risk-based duties shape enterprise deployment strategies. 11

## Audience, Scope & Personas
- **Executives**: decision support, adoption ROI, risk posture.
- **Managers**: policy-aware rollouts, measure impact.
- **Analysts/SMEs**: find, compare, and explain internal knowledge quickly.
- **IT/Compliance**: controls, logs, model/config lifecycle.

## Capabilities
- Connectors for docs/wikis/PDFs → cleaning/chunking
- Embeddings + vector DB → semantic retrieval
- Role-aware prompting → briefs, decisions, adoption hints
- Guardrails: PII masking, policy checks, audit logs

## Outcomes
- **SMB**: 20–40% reduction in repetitive knowledge queries (target).  
- **Enterprise**: policy-aware retrieval, auditability, and faster time-to-answer at scale.
